# CTR Behavior Analytics on Large-Scale Taobao Ad Dataset

This project explores click-through rate (CTR) behavior using a large-scale dataset from Alibabaâ€™s Tianchi platform. The goal is to understand what factors influence user engagement with ads by analyzing patterns in demographics, ad content, and behavioral data.

## Project Overview

We work with three datasets:
- `raw_sample.csv`: User-ad interactions (clicks and views)
- `ad_feature.csv`: Metadata related to each ad (price, category, brand, etc.)
- `user_profile.csv`: Demographics and user behavior profiles

After individual preprocessing, these datasets are merged and explored to identify the key drivers of CTR.

## Key Highlights

- Handled over 26 million interaction logs to understand click behavior
- Preprocessed and optimized memory usage across large datasets
- Extracted features like hour of interaction, user category segments, and ad price ranges
- Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover trends in user and ad performance

## Dataset Source
